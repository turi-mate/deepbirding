### Project members: Bence Bihari (IVXWF8), Lehel Hegyi (GSZLZ7), Máté Turi (...)
### Project description: 
This is a university project teamwork for the Deep Learning course. We are taking part in the BirdCLEF competition, where we are creating a deep learning model that can identify and classify different kinds of bird's chirping. The initial dataset can be found in the official BirdCLEF description

### Resources used for data preparation:

### Dataset Acquisition:
- One possible solution is to create a user on Kaggle and enter the BirdCLEF competition
- Request a Kaggle.json file key that authenticates the user in colab
- With this key and with using the Kaggle api the user can fetch the dataset and use it for the modell
- In our case we have attached Google Drive to Colab downloaded the dataset there, this way there is no need for downloading the dataset on every runtime modification of Colab
