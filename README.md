## Deepbirding
### Project members: Bence Bihari (IVXWF8), Lehel Hegyi (GSZLZ7), Máté Turi (...)
### Project description: 
This is a university project teamwork for the Deep Learning course. We are taking part in the BirdCLEF competition, where we are creating a deep learning model that can identify and classify different kinds of bird's chirping. The initial dataset can be found in the official BirdCLEF description

### Resources used for data preparation:

### Dataset acquisition:
- One possible solution is to create a user on Kaggle and enter the BirdCLEF 2023 competition

- Add the recieved kaggle.json file upload the file to Google Colab:

- With this key the code is able to retrieve the dataset from Kaggle:

- After this the data will be rady for use
- In our case we have attached Google Drive to Colab downloaded the dataset there, this way there is no need for downloading the dataset on every runtime modification of Colab
